## Server Endpoints

| Endpoint URL             | Action | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/auth/github`           |  GET   | WebApp calls this to start the GitHub login process                                        |
| `/auth/github/callback`  |  GET   | The "auth callback URL" value from your app page on github.com, ALSO inside `/server/.env` |
| `/auth/profile`          |  GET   | Used by React app to get profile. GitHub auth required; checks req.user for login          |
| `/auth/logout`           |  GET   | Used by React app directly. Call passport's logout, ends session, and redirects to React   |
| `/auth/success-callback` |  GET   | A "sanity check" only used when we test GitHub server, in `/server/.env`                   |
| `/api/v1/posts/`         |  GET   | Gets all posts. Adds `isCurrentUser` if the user is logged in (via session)                |
| `/api/v1/posts/`         |  POST  | Create a new post, requires GitHub login                                                   |

## The Workflow

- USER clicks on the link to a URL hosted on the SERVER.(1)
- The SERVER redirects the user to a link to the PROVIDER. (2)
- USER accepts the permission
- PROVIDER redirects to a callback URL on the SERVER
- SERVER will authenticate using passport. If all goes well, we'll get the provider's info of the user.
- the SERVER will map that provider info to a user on the database, or create a new user.
- If all goes well SERVER then redirects to the CLIENT's home page or a failure page depending on the circumstances.

(1) This is different from what we have usually done; up until now, any URL we've it on the server has returned JSON. That's why there's no `/api` in front of it.
(2) This is the modal box where they ask the user if they agree.
